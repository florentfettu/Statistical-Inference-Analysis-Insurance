# Statistical-Inference-Analysis-Insurance

## Description
The topic of our dataset is about the costs of health insurance that American citizens have to pay. In order to contextualize our subject, it's necessary to mention that the American health system is very different from that of Canada.

Indeed, access to healthcare is not easy in the United States. Without health insurance, a hospital has the right to refuse admission to the emergency room, and any surgery can cost tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, it goes without saying that health insurance is more than essential in the United States. So we think it would be interesting to identify the predictors most likely to influence the cost of health insurance in the United States among those available in our database.

The goal of our analysis is to assess the impact of the body mass index and being a smoker (or not) on the costs of health insurance in the United States, taking into account socio-demographic variables.
